# Form Validation

We should avoid building and maintaining our own validation library at all costs.
For this reason we will rely on third party libraries for validating user input.

The React-Redux-Form library provides a [validation hook](https://davidkpiano.gitbooks.io/react-redux-form/content/validation.html) to plug into.
